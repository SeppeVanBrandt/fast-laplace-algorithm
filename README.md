# fast-laplace-algorithm

#This code implements the Fast Laplace Algorithm as it is described in
#[1] S. D. Babacan, R. Molina and A. K. Katsaggelos, "Bayesian Compressive Sensing Using Laplace Priors,"
#[2] Tipping, Michael E., and Anita C. Faul. "Fast marginal likelihood maximisation for sparse Bayesian models."

#A polynomial class is implemented and multiple polynomials families are made available as basis functions for the fast Laplace algorithm.
