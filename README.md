# fast-laplace-algorithm

This code implements the Fast Laplace Algorithm as it is described in

[1] S. D. Babacan, R. Molina and A. K. Katsaggelos, "Bayesian Compressive Sensing Using Laplace Priors,"

[2] Tipping, Michael E., and Anita C. Faul. "Fast marginal likelihood maximisation for sparse Bayesian models."

The fast Laplace algorithm is an algorithm that implements Bayesian compressive sensing for building sparse models. By applying a Laplace prior distribution on the expansion coefficients, a sparse expansion can be constructed efficiently for high dimensional problems.

A polynomial class is implemented and multiple polynomials families are made available as basis functions for the fast Laplace algorithm.
